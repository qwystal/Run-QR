# Run-QR
An app for Android to scan QR-Codes and play them.

## Description
This app can scan QR-Codes and play the game within. The games have to be in HTML. 

This entire project was just a project for school and I'm not really proud of it, as could have done so much more. But it's my very first program in Java.

The idea came from the video 'Can you fit a whole game into a QR code?' from MattKC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExwqNreocpg

My games could fit games in one QR-Code, but it didn't work, because my library couldn't detect it, so I had to split the QR-Codes up and make two or more QR-Codes instead of one.

I hate designing.
